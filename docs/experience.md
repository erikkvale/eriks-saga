Supportive research environment, where I have learned new ways of building data-centric applications and managing the data that feeds those applications.

- Developed ETL processes through use of SQL scripts, stored procedures, SSIS packages and later through Python and other open-source libraries.

- Worked with senior programmers and economists in developing applications for economics applications both internally and for external clients

- Wrote programs to decode historical binary files and convert into necessary data types for persistent storage in relational databases

- Rebuilt internal servers, updated hardware and software, put back into production

- Configured arrays of virtual machines to batch build historical economics models using proprietary software
