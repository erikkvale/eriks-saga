## Experience
??? note "Principal Software Engineer - AcuStaf Development Corporation"
    March 2021 – Present

    Focus on architecture and process improvement for new product line. 

    - Focus on shifting more responsibility to code owners in terms
    of integration and deployment (CI-CD) and security ("shift-left" approach). Lowering barrier and distributing that responsibility to reduce the need for more FTEs on the Ops side.
    - Advocate for Everything as Code (EaC) for better governance and cohesion of things
    like documentation and diagrams, along with things like application code and infrastructure.
    - Introduced Terraform to manage Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
    - Built out "sandbox" AWS environment for intermedidate features and functionalities
    to provide more transparency to stakeholders and the team
    - Introduced patterns to junior engineers to use for developing event-driven microservices in Python
    - Introduced and built out GraphQL APIs to provide client apps with a more unified 
    API approach
    - Continuing to develop company's cloud architecture in AWS.


??? note "Senior Data Engineer - phData, Inc."
    March 2020 – March 2021
    
    Data Engineering consulting across multiple industries and projects

    - Built out data pipelines and data flows to support downstream data scientists
    - Extensive work with Hadoop ecosystem: HDFS, MapReduce, Hive, Impala.
    - Worked on cloud native data engineering projects in AWS including
    corporate IAM user federation and database migrations.


??? note "Senior Software Engineer - AcuStaf Development Corporation"     
    October 2018 – November 2019
    Greater Minneapolis-St. Paul Area

    - Helped guide adoption of new tech stack that best met the constraints of the current team, yet allowed us to move towards modern, well-supported technologies and avoid technical debt.
    - Advocate for democratic, fact-based decisions in the adoption of those technologies, focusing on the problem at hand and what solutions best apply and which of those solutions can be maintained by the team with minimal strain.
    - Introduced Docker, 12-factor app principles, and applied other best practices for application development, including Test Driven Development (TDD) and test coverage reporting.
    - Developed new interview structure for back-end engineers, focusing on their creativity and ability to build flexible and reusable OOP software, not just puzzles and theory-heavy CS problems. Conducted technical interviews for engineering candidates.
    - Worked with team in integrating new and consistent Git version control processes and administered git-flow workflow for our software release workflow. Reducing process ambiguity and giving the team and myself more reliance on the process and quality of the software releases.
    - Conducted initial software architecture conversations and analyses, evaluating trade-offs of monolithic and microservice-oriented architectures.
    - Built and tested company's first REST API prototypes. Helped develop new production-ready REST APIs with collaborative front-end and back-end engineers.


??? note "Software Engineer - University of Idaho"
    April 2017 – April 2018
    Moscow, Idaho

    Re-designing a legacy software application and building out the back-end of a dynamic web platform to assist university economists and policy group members in their research and analysis.

    - Established infrastructure and road map of growth and project evolution for future collaborators
    - Designed, built, tested and configured web services (RESTful API) for internal use
    - Developed prototypes of front-end dashboards to ingest back-end data (web service)
    - Developed submit-review-accept process and communication medium for translating economic theory and ideas from experimental environments to production code.
    - Designed, built, and tested all other project-related libraries: data pipelines, linear algebra, and documentation.


??? note "Data/Software Engineer - Alward Institute for Collaborative Science"
    October 2014 – December 2017
    Huntersville, NC; Fountain Hills, AZ (remote); Pullman, WA (remote)

    Supportive research environment, where I have learned new ways of building data-centric applications and managing the data that feeds those applications.

    - Developed ETL processes through use of SQL scripts, stored procedures, SSIS packages and later through Python and other open-source libraries.
    - Worked with senior programmers and economists in developing applications for economics applications both internally and for external clients
    - Wrote programs to decode historical binary files and convert into necessary data types for persistent storage in relational databases
    - Rebuilt internal servers, updated hardware and software, put back into production
    - Configured arrays of virtual machines to batch build historical economics models using proprietary software
